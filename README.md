# NYC Rent & Crime Analysis Dashboard

**Interactive Data Science Project | Python, Dash, Plotly, Pandas**

This project analyzes the relationship between **housing affordability and crime patterns in New York City** from 2015 to 2024.  It combines exploratory data analysis, geospatial visualization, and an interactive dashboard to support data-driven urban insights.



## 📌 Project Overview

- **Objective:**  
  Examine how crime severity relates to median rent levels across NYC neighborhoods, precincts, and ZIP codes.

- **Key Questions:**
  - How do crime trends evolve over time by category?
  - Are higher-rent areas associated with lower crime severity?
  - Which precincts exhibit disproportionately high crime relative to rent?
  - How does accessibility to amenities vary by ZIP code?

- **Outcome:**  
  A fully interactive **Dash dashboard** that allows users to explore trends across **time, geography, crime category, and area**.

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. Interactive EDA Dashboard
- Dynamic filtering by:
  - Date range
  - Crime category (Felony / Misdemeanor / Violation)
  - Geographic area
- Responsive multi-panel layout with synchronized updates

### 2. Advanced Visual Analytics
- Time series analysis of crime and rent trends
- Box plots for rent distribution by borough
- Heatmaps for crime-to-rent “Danger Ratio”
- Scatter analysis of crime vs. housing cost
- Choropleth map of median rent by ZIP code

### 3. Geospatial Map Explorer
- ZIP-based search with:
  - Nearby amenities (supermarkets, hospitals, transit, parks, etc.)
  - Walking-time distance filtering
- Google Maps APIs integration (Geocoding, Places, Distance Matrix)



## Methodology
### Danger Ratio (Core Metric)

To normalize crime intensity by cost of living, a **Danger Ratio** is defined as:

**Danger Ratio = Weighted Crime Count / Median Rent**

**Crime Severity Weights**
- Felony: 3  
- Misdemeanor: 2  
- Violation: 1  

This metric captures relative crime exposure per dollar of rent, enabling
a normalized comparison of safety versus housing cost across NYC areas.

## 🔗 Related Work

This project has a complementary visualization-focused implementation using **D3.js**:

- **NYC Rent & Crime Analysis (D3 / Observable)**  
  [Link to Observable notebook](https://observablehq.com/@nyuinfovis/nye-crime-rent-analysis)

The two projects use the **same dataset and research question**, but differ in:
- **This repo:** Data science workflow, analytics, dashboard engineering  
- **Observable project:** Custom visual encoding and front-end visualization design


## 🚀 Running the Dashboard Locally

To run the interactive dashboard on your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/nyc-rent-crime-analysis.git
cd nyc-rent-crime-analysis
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

Then open your browser at:
```text
http://localhost:8054
```

> Note: Google Maps functionality requires a valid API key with Geocoding, Places, and Distance Matrix APIs enabled.
